{{stack end |float=right}}
'''Hilversum''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦɪlvərsɵm|-|Nl-Hilversum.ogg}}) is a municipality and a city in the [[Netherlands]], in the province of [[North Holland]]. Located in the region called &quot;[[Het Gooi]]&quot;, it is the largest town in that area. It is surrounded by [[heathland]], [[forest|wood]]s, [[meadow]]s, lakes, and smaller towns. Hilversum is part of the [[Randstad]], one of the largest [[conurbation]]s in Europe.

==The town==
Hilversum lies {{convert|31|km|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Amsterdam]] and {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].

The town is often called &quot;media city&quot; since it is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in The Netherlands. [[Radio Netherlands]], heard worldwide via [[shortwave radio]] since the 1920s, is also based here. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television [[studio]]s belonging to the national broadcast production company [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS (Nederlandse Omroep Stichting)]], as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies. As a result, many old AM radio sets in Europe had a ''Hilversum'' dial position marked on their tuning scales (along with [[Athlone]], [[Kalundborg]] and others).

Hilversum is also known for its architecturally important [[Hilversum Town Hall|Town Hall (Raadhuis Hilversum)]], designed by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and built in 1931.

Hilversum has one public library, two swimming pools (Van Hellemond Sport and De Lieberg), a number of sporting halls and several shopping centers (such as Hilvertshof, De Gijsbrecht, Kerkelanden, Riebeeck Galerij and Seinhorst.) In the region, the city centre is called &quot;het dorp&quot;, which means &quot;the village&quot;.

==History==
Earthenware found in Hilversum gives its name to the [[Hilversum culture]], which is an early- to mid-Bronze Age, or 800–1200 BCE [[material culture]]. Artifacts from this prehistoric civilization bear similarities to the Wessex Culture of southern Britain and may indicate that the first Hilversum residents emigrated from that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Hilversum/Overview/History |title=Hilversum: Overview - History |publisher=Iguide.travel |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first brick settlements formed around 900, but it was not until 1305 that the first official mention of Hilversum (&quot;Hilfersheem&quot; from &quot;Hilvertshem&quot; meaning &quot;houses between the hills&quot;) is found. At that point it was a part of [[Naarden]], the oldest town in the Gooi area.

[[File:Johannes Bosboom - Interieur van een boerendeel bij Hilversum.jpg|thumb|left|''Interior of a farm near Hilversum'', a 19th-century drawing by [[Johannes Bosboom]]]]
Farming, raising sheep and some wool manufacturing were the means of life for the Gooi in the Middle Ages. In 1424, on 21 March at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am (the hour at which people got up, as the farm was full of restless and loud animals), Hilversum received its first official independent status. This made possible further growth in the village because permission from Naarden was no longer needed for new industrial development. The town grew further in the 17th century when the Dutch economy as a whole entered its age of prosperity, and several canals were built connecting it indirectly to Amsterdam. In 1725 and 1766 large fires destroyed most of the town, leveling parts of the old townhouse and the church next to it. The town overcame these setbacks and the textile industry continued to develop, among other ways by devising a way to weave cows' hair.  In the 19th century a substantial textile and tapestry industry emerged, aided by a railway link to Amsterdam in 1874.  From that time the town grew quickly with rich commuters from Amsterdam moving in, building themselves large villas in the wooded surroundings, and gradually starting to live in Hilversum permanently.  Despite this growth, Hilversum was never granted [[city rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] so it is still referred to by many locals as &quot;het dorp,&quot; or &quot;the village.&quot;

For the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in neighboring [[Amsterdam]], it hosted all of the non-jumping [[Equestrian at the 1928 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and the running part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1928/1928.pdf 1928 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 271–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the headquarters of the German ground forces ([[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]) in the Netherlands {{citation needed|reason=Time reference needed|date=April 2015}}.

The ''Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek'' (NSF) company established a professional transmitter and radio factory in Hilversum in the early 1920s, growing into the largest of its kind in the Netherlands, and in 1948 being taken over by [[Philips]]. By then the textile industry had started its decline; only one factory, Veneta, managed to continue into the 1960s, when it also had to close its doors. Another major industry, the chemical factory IFF, also closed by the end of the 1960s. In the meantime, almost all Dutch radio broadcasting organizations (followed by television broadcasters in the 1950s) established their headquarters in Hilversum and provided a source of continuing economic growth.  The concentration of broadcasters in Hilversum has given it its enduring status as the media city for the Netherlands.

In 1964, the population reached a record high – over 103,000 people called Hilversum home.  The current population hovers around 85,000.  Several factors figure into the decline:  one is the fact that the average family nowadays consists of fewer people, so fewer people live in each house; second, the town is virtually unable to expand because all the surrounding lands were sold by city architect [[Willem Marinus Dudok|W.M. Dudok]] to the [[Goois Natuurreservaat]] (''[[:nl:Goois Natuurreservaat|nl]]''). The third reason for this decline of the population was because the property values were increasing rapidly in that moment of time, and many people were forced to move to less expensive areas in the Netherlands.

Some sources blame connections in the television world for attracting crime to Hilversum; the town has had to cope with mounting drug-related issues in a community with higher than average unemployment and ongoing housing shortage.

Hilversum was one of the first towns to have a local party of the populist movement called [[Livable Netherlands|''Leefbaar'' (&quot;liveable&quot;)]]. Founded by former social-democrat party strongman Jan Nagel, it was initially held at bay for alderman positions. In 2001, Nagel from 'Leefbaar Hilversum' teamed up with 'Leefbaar Utrecht' leaders to found a national 'Leefbaar Nederland' party. By strange coincidence, in 2002 the most vocal 'Leefbaar Rotterdam' politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] was shot and killed by an animal rights activist at [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Hilversum Media Park]] just after finishing a radio interview. This happened, however, after a break between Fortuyn and Nagel during a Leefbaar Nederland board meeting in Hilversum on Fortuyn's anti-Islamic viewpoints.

The town of Hilversum has put a great deal of effort into improvements, including a recent renovation to its central train station, thorough renovation of the main shopping centre (Hilvertshof), and development of new dining and retail districts downtown including the &quot;vintage&quot; district in the Leeuwenstraat.  Several notable architectural accomplishments include the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision|Institute for Sound and Vision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |title=Beeld en Geluid |publisher=Experience.beeldengeluid.nl |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091118210918/http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |archivedate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zanderij Crailoo]] (''[[:nl:Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo|nl]]''), the largest man-made [[wildlife crossing]] in the world.

The nearby [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Media Park]] was the scene of [[Assassination of Pim Fortuyn|the 2002 assassination]] of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], and of a January 29, 2015 [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting#2015 gunman incident|fake gunman]] demanding airtime at [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]]'s headquarters.

The population declined from 103,000 in 1964 to 84,000 in 2006.

* The large Catholic neo-gothic St. Vitus church ([[Pierre Cuypers|P.J.H. Cuypers]], 1892, belltower 96 metres).
* The city played host to many landscape artists during the 19th century, including [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek]].

Hilversum is well connected to the Dutch railway network, and contains three stations: 
* [[Hilversum railway station]]
* [[Hilversum Media Park railway station]]
* [[Hilversum Sportpark railway station]]

One can get the best connections from the station Hilversum, as this is an Intercity station.

==Local government==
[[File:Hilversum centrum A.jpg|thumb|right|Hilversum city centre]]
The municipal council of Hilversum in 2010 consists of 37 seats, which are divided as followed:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilversum.nl/live/index.jsp?det=255353 ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Democrats 66|D66]] – 8 seats
* [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] – 7 seats
* [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] – 6 seats
* [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]] – 3 seats
* [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] – 3 seats
* [[GroenLinks]] – 3 seats
* Hart voor Hilversum – 3 seats
* [[ChristenUnie]] – 2 seats
* [[Leefbaar]] Hilversum – 2 seats

It was the first city with a &quot;[[Livable Netherlands|Leefbaar]]&quot; party (which was intended as just a local party).
